## Evaluating the availability of EV charging stations throughout various communities
As the purchase of electric vehicles increase, access to EV charging stations is vital
## Research question
My research question is: find out where are EV charging stations located throughout LA County and where should more stations be installed to improve access?
## Data sources
In this project, I am looking at location of EV charging stations using the data from my job as well this link [https://www.plugshare.com/directory/us/california/los-angeles]
Does income levels play a role as to where EV charging stations are installed, I am looking at Census reports, this is the link [https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2023.S1901?q=S1901&g=040XX00US06_050XX00US06037]

I am done with my project proposal.

## What I expect to find
I expect to find that income levels play a significant role as to where EV charging stations are installed and that lower income communities have less access to EV charging stations. The goal of my finding is to highlight the differences and advocate for more EV charging stations in lower income communities.
